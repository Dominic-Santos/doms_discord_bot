<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This passion project was created to provide better tools and automation for my local game store. As a PokÃ©mon Professor (Judge), I found the official tools to be severely lacking. To help address those shortcomings, I developed this bot to keep the community informed and streamline everyday operations â€” from deck checks to tournament sign-ups and more.

## Create Your Own Bot

If youâ€™d like to run your own version of the bot, feel free to fork or copy the code from this repository ðŸ˜Š A shoutout is always appreciated!

### Discord App

Youâ€™ll need to create a Discord application. Follow the official guide [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

The bot requires permissions to post messages in channels and manage events.

### Configure the App

Refer to the example below and fill out your own `config.json`:
```json
{
    "app_token": "app_token_placeholder",
    "admin_password": "123abc",
    "maintenance_mode": true
}
```
* app_token: this is provided by Discord when creating the Discord App.
* admin_password: this is used by super-admin to control the bot via discord commands, make up your own.
* maintenance_mode: if the bot will start in maintenance mode.

### Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the bot
```sh
python main.py
```

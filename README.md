<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a passion project aimed at providing better tools and automation for my local game store. As a PokÃ©mon Professor (Judge), I found the official tools to be severely lacking. To help alleviate some of the pain points, Iâ€™ve been developing this bot with features designed to keep the community informed and streamline daily operations â€” from deck checks to sign-ups and more.

## Create your own bot

If youâ€™d like to run your own version of the bot, feel free to fork, use, or copy the code in this repo ðŸ˜Š A mention is always appreciated!

### Discord App

You will need to create a discord app, follow the guide [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

The bot will require permissions to post messages in channels and manage events

### Configure the App

Follow the example in config.json and fill out the fields:
```json
{
    "app_token": "app_token_placeholder",
    "admin_password": "123abc",
    "maintenance_mode": true
}
```
* app_token: this is provided by Discord when creating the Discord App.
* admin_password: this is used by super-admin to control the bot via discord commands.
* maintenance_mode: if the bot will start in maintenance mode.

### Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Roles based commands

Some commands are intended for server admins only. We recommend restricting access to commands based on server roles, which can be configured through your server's integration settings.

Admin commands:

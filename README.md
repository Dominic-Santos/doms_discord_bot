<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a passion project aimed at providing better tools and automation for my local game store. As a PokÃ©mon Professor (Judge), I found the official tools to be severely lacking. To help alleviate some of the pain points, Iâ€™ve been developing this bot with features designed to keep the community informed and streamline daily operations â€” from deck checks to sign-ups and more.

### Discord App

The bot will require permissions to post messages in channels and manage events.

```json

    "app_token": "app_token_placeholder",

}
```
* app_token: this is provided by Discord when creating the Discord App.
